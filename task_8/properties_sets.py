"""
Properties of Sets:
Sets can contain similar and dissimilar types of elements
The set is written using curly bracket {}
Indexing is not possible in sets
In sets, duplicates are not allowed, they will be deleted
We can add elements to a set
To perform mathematical operations on a set, use union, intersection, and minus (|, &, -)
The set can be modified, but the elements inside of it are immutable

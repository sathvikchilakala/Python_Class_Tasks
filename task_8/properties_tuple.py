Properties of Tuples:
Tuples are ordered, they will give an output in the same order as the sequence given
Tuples allow duplicate numbers (just like a set)
It is indicated by using parenthesis ()
Tuples allow for indexing, you may add/ take out elements from the set
Tuples, unlike lists, are immutable- they cannot be changed after created
Delete, append, and other features are not supported because the sequence is immutable
